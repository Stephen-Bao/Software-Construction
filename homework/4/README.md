The game can be started either by gradle run command or by running the Main class in edu.cmu.cs.cs214.hw4.gui.GameGUI.

One player should enter the total player number in the starter window, then the main GUI will show up. A tile can be rotated by 90 degree clockwise by clicking on it either on the above tile panel or on the board. Each player has a default color to differentiate their meeples. Player is changed after a tile is placed. When there is no tile left in the deck, the game ends.
