hw5b Feedback
============

#### Core Framework Implementation (67/70)

* Technical requirements (30/30)
  * Your framework meets the technical requirements to a reasonable degree. Good job!
* Framework functionality (12/12)
  * Your framework works reasonably well. Good job!
* Unit Testing (8/8)
  * You have done a reasonable level of testing. Good job!
* General design (17/20)
  * The plug-ins have direct access to parts of the framework internals that should only be accessible to the framework UI.

#### Sample Plugins (18/30)

* -3, You did not use a third-party library or web API for any of your sample data plugins. One of the requirements of this assignment was to learn to use libraries without any prior knowledge by reading the documentation rather than writing everything from scratch.
* -5, Your data plugins are structurally almost identical. The goal of writing multiple plugins was to highlight the variety of plugins that your framework supports.
* -4, The provided data plugins did not explore the space of possible plugins in a way compatible with the goals of the assignment. The intent was for the data plugins to access novel data sources and make that data available for processing by the framework.	Ex: json vs csv, txt vs pdf

#### High quality documentation and style (23/25)

* Documentation (15/15)
* Project Configuration and Gradle (3/5)
  * -2, Your build.gradle file does not include any of the build tools emphasized in the class, such as Checkstyle and Spotbugs. We were expecting your build to run these tools so that you could catch problems early and uniformly.
* Style (5/5)
