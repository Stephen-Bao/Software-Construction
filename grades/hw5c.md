============

#### Working Project (10/10)

#### Plugin Implementation (40/50)

* Data Plugins (20/25)
  * Your data plugins are all almost identical. Specifically, they are all parsing JSON files or XML files. We expected a higher variety in the plugins like using some different types of web APIs for example. You did not take full advantage of the framework.
* Visualization Plugins (20/25)
  * Your visualization plugins are all very similar. We were expecting more creativity and library usage. Both of your plugins use xchart and have very similar code. We were also expecting more substance than what was given in your Pie chart plugin.
